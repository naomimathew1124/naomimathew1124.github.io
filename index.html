    <p>Welcome to my online portfolio! I recently graduated from University  
       of California, Riverside with my bachelor’s degree in Mathematics. 
       During college, I cultivated a passion for problem solving and using  
       abstract concepts to come up with practical ideas. In addition to math,  
       I also really enjoy coding. Here you’ll get to see some of my most  
       recent work!</p>
