        <p>Hi! Welcome to my online portfolio! I recently graduated from University  
           of California, Riverside with my bachelor’s degree in Mathematics. 
           During college, I cultivated a passion for problem solving and using  
           abstract concepts to come up with practical ideas. In addition to math,  
           I also really enjoy coding. Here you’ll get to see some of my most  
           recent work!</p>
